# Flight-Fare-Prediction-and-implementation-using-Web-App
Flight Fare Prediction by comparing various machine learning models and implementing it with a Web Application using Flask.

What is the going on?
We are trying to accomodate various machine learning algorithms in the model to compare the accuracy of each and every model for each and every feature
individually and testing it as a whole and then using the best algorithm for the prediction purpose.


How to Run the code->
Step-1-> Extract the zip file to extract the model.
Step-2-> run the webapp.py code and follow the link it gives and you are good to go.
